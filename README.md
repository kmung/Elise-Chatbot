## Elise Chatbot

This chatbot is taken from the book [Artificial Intelligence for Developers](https://ineasysteps.com/products-page/artificial-intelligence-developers-in-easy-steps/) by Richard Urwin. It is based on the Eliza chatbot, known to be the first chatbot, published by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966.

### Running this chatbot on your machine

I would recommend using a virtual environment. Python's venv is a good choise

```bash
    python -m venv /venv-name-of-your-choice
    source /venv-name-of-your-choice/bin/activate
    python Elise.py
```

```bash
    source /venv-name-of-your-choice/bin/activate
```

```bash
    python Elise.py
```
